# Trade Genii: Revolutionizing Trading with AI

## Overview
Trade Genii is an innovative AI-driven trading solution that leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to create a highly efficient and user-friendly trading environment. At its core is the Trade Genie, an AI Agent designed to handle all trading scenarios through natural language processing (NLP), making trading more intuitive and accessible.

## Key Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Trade Genii allows users to interact with the trading system using natural language, simplifying the process of placing orders, querying market data, and managing trades.
- **FIX Protocol Integration**: The system employs the Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol, a widely-used standard in the financial industry, ensuring seamless communication and execution of trading commands.
- **Agent-Based Trading via MCP Protocol**: Trade Genii utilizes the MCP protocol to deploy Agents that send trading commands to FIX counterparties, enabling efficient and reliable trade execution.
- **Support for Multiple LLMs**: Trade Genii is compatible with a variety of large language models, including those in the OpenAI format, as well as models from Ollama, DeepSeek, and Tongyi Qianwen. This flexibility allows users to choose the model that best suits their needs.

## Benefits
